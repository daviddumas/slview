# Datasets for SL(View)

The datasets `psl2z*.json` and `disc*.json` are arithmetic Fuchsian
groups generated with programs in the `/arith` directory of the repo.

The datasets `ex-*.json` were generated by hand to exhibit special
features of the model (such as the position of elliptics, half-turns,
etc.)

TODO: Add scripts that generate `ex-*` to the repo.
